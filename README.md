# SpookyStreet
Spooky Street text based game is a Python project I worked on to help learn Python. In the game the player is to discover the different houses located on spooky street on Halloween Trick or Treat night and get candy from each house. As the player discovers each house, they must not find the house that has the game villian Mr. Boo. If they do Mr. Boo will steal all of the players candy and the player loses the game. If the player is able to collect all 6 candies they will then win the game.

This game helped me understand the general concepts of functions and loops while also implementing lists and libraries.
